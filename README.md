## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Pymaceuticals specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In its most recent efforts, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.
In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

The code is written using jupyter notebook.


## ‚úçÔ∏è Observable Trends <a name = "trends"></a>
From the data of 249 mice identified these were the trends observeved -
- Ramicane regimen performes as good as Capomulin regimen.
- Ketapril and Naftisol regimen increased the  tumor volume significantly.
- Capomulin regimen has been more effective for female mice.

What can be clearly seen in the  mices for Capomulin regimen between tumor volume and weight has positive slope - indicating as weight increase in mouse , the tumor volume increase linearly. There is higher correlation between tumor volume and timepoint for Capomulin regimen.
