## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, we'll be utilizing a  Python library, and the OpenWeatherMap API to create a representative model of weather across world cities.
Series of scatter plots are created to showcase the following relationships:
</br>

-Temperature (F) vs. Latitude</br>
-Humidity (%) vs. Latitude</br>
-Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude</br>
-Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude</br>


Second part includes ,Running linear regression on each relationship, only this time separating them into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude)

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

-Randomly selected at least 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude.
-Performed a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.
-Included a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.
-Saved a CSV of all retrieved data and a PNG image for each scatter plot.


## ‚úçÔ∏è Observable Trends <a name = "trends"></a>
<b>Part-1</b>
From the data of 249 mice identified these were the trends observeved -
- Ramicane regimen performes as good as Capomulin regimen.
- Ketapril and Naftisol regimen increased the  tumor volume significantly.
- Capomulin regimen has been more effective for female mice.

What can be clearly seen in the  mices for Capomulin regimen between tumor volume and weight has positive slope - indicating as weight increase in mouse , the tumor volume increase linearly. There is higher correlation between tumor volume and timepoint for Capomulin regimen.
